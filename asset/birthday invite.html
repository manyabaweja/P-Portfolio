<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>Celebration with a themed party is always a fun idea! I would really appreciate if you'd dress in black. </p>
<h2>What to bring?</h2>
<ul>
    One food item (there'll be lots of food)
    Your fav songs playlist (a party without dope music would be damn boring and bland)
    Don't forget to bring me a cool present (Just kidding!!)
</ul>
<h2>This is where you need to go</h2>
